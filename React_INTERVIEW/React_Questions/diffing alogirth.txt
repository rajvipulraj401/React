What is diffing algorithm or reconciliation in Reactjs?

It’s a very important topic for Frontend interview and many people don’t know about it. 

I’ve tried to explain it in very easy 4 points. 

1️⃣ When you update the state of a component in ReactJS, React creates a new virtual tree (called the "next tree") that represents the updated UI.

2️⃣ React then compares the "next tree" with the previous virtual tree (called the "current tree") to identify the differences between them.

3️⃣ Once React has identified the differences between the two trees, it only updates the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.

4️⃣ This process is called "reconciliation" or "diffing". It's what makes ReactJS fast and efficient, as it reduces the number of updates needed to render the UI.
